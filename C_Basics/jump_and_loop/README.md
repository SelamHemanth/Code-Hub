1) Write a program to print all prime numbers between 2 given numbers.  Print how many prime numbers are found at the end.


2) Read 6 subject marks of n students and count how many of them scored above 80% and print the count. use nested loop to read the marks for 6 subjects and calculate the sum and percentage.

3)  Read m subject marks of n students ( take number of subjects as input for every student, and accordingly read the marks and calculate percentage ) and print who is the topper. Assume every student chooses different number of subjects in their course.

4) print the below pattern using while loop & for loop & do while loop in three different programs:
*
* *
* * *
* * * *
* * * * *

4) print the below patterns using nested loops:


* * * * *
* * * *
