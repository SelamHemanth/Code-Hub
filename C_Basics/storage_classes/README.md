Storage classes Lab Assignments:

Rewrite the calculator program so that the main function is in main.c , remaining functions are in another source code file, operations.c.

1) Create the operand variables as global variables and use them in the operation functions directly, without passing as arguments. Function returns the result as return value.
2) Create the operand variables as global variables and use them in the operation functions directly, without passing as arguments. Function return value should be stored in another global variable in operations file and be used to print in main.


3) WAP - for the 4 departments of a super market : Sales, Purchase, Stock and SuperMarket in four different source code files.
Stock : Maintains a variable for available stock.
Sales : Has one function: Sell – It will reduce the stock by the number of items sold. Before selling check if enough stock is available.
Purchase : Has one function : Purchase – will increase the stock by the number of items purchased.Set a max value for stock, before purchasing check if the stock room has enough space for new items or not.
SuperMarket : Display menu with choices : 1 ) check AvailableStock 2 ) Purchase new items 3) Sell items … this should be continuous as long as the user wants to continue. Program should stop when the user wants to quit.

4) WAP - with a function that prints the following message every nth time it is called : Hello! I am called nth time. Print the appropriate subscript after the n, depending on the last digit.
Output : The function should print the following ,
I am called 1st time.
I am called 2nd time.``
I am called 3rd time…etc.
The subscripts also should be printed appropriately. (st, nd ,rd and th etc.).
Hint : numbers ending with 1 will have st as subscript.
Numbers ending with 2 will have nd as subscript.
Similarly, numbers ending with 3 will have rd and all the remaining numbers will have th.
