The skip character is used in read and print values

For example:-

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
int a;
char b;
printf("Enter two values:");
scanf("%d %c",&a,&b);
printf("%d %d",a,b);
}

output:-
Enter two values:4 A
4 65

In the above example, in scanf() space is also takes as a character,by skipping the space in output, we need to mention space in printf() between the two format spacifiers.
For skipping, the getchar() function is also used to skip the space,enter key value.

For example:-

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
int a;
char b;
printf("Enter a,b values");
scanf("%d",&a);
getchar();
scanf("%c",&b);
printf("%d%d",a,b);
}

op1:-
Enter a,b values4 A
432

op2:-
Enter a,b values4 A
465

In op1 is the output without using of getchar().so,the space ascii values is printed along with "a" number
In op2 is the output by using getchar().so,the space is skipped and then printed 465.Beacause "A" ascii value is 65.
