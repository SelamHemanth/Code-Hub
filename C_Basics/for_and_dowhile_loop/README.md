Write the below programs using for loop:

1) Read a set of numbers (number of inputs is n, it is to be taken as input first) and print if each given number is smaller or bigger than the previous number. For first number there will not be any output as there is no previous number. 

2) Read a set of positive numbers only in ascending order. stop reading when user enters a negative number. While reading the numbers, if the user enters a bigger number than previous number, then continue to read next number. If the number is smaller than previous number, then do not consider it, and take input again. Print the number of proper inputs taken at the end of the loop.

eg inputs: 
10  
12
11 - wrong input ,please enter a number bigger than 12
15 
18
17 - wrong input. please enter a number bigger than 18
16 - wrong input, please enter a number bigger than 18
11 - wrong input, please enter a number bigger than 18
19
-1
output: 5

3) Write a program to input n numbers (number of inputs is n, it is to be taken as input first) and print the largest and smallest numbers out of them.

Eg., 3,23,56,34,78,45,26,90,68,77
Biggest Number is 90
Smallest Number is 3

4)Write a program to print the first n Fibonacci numbers.

Eg., First 8 Fibonacci numbers are :
1  1  2  3  5  8  13  21

5)Write a program to find the reverse of an integer.

input : 587
output : 785


Write below programs using do while loop:

6) Write a program to input a number and count the digits in it.
Eg.
0 - number of digits 1
12 – number of digits 2
155 – number of digits 3

7) Modify the calculator program to perform the operations continuously until the user chooses not to continue further. Ask if the user wants to continue after every operation.

8) Write prime number program using do while loop`
