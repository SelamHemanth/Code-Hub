1) List out the data types, their format specifiers.

2) create variables of all data types and then read and print their values using scanf and printf.

3) Calculation of simple interest.
   steps:
	1)declare 2 integer variables p and n to represent principle and duration in months re          spectively.
	2)declare a floating point variable r to represent rate of interest.
	3)declare a floating point variable si to store simple interest after calculation.
	4)declare a floating point variable m to represent time duration in years.
	5)print the following indicative message using printf
 	   "please enter principle,time in months and rate of interest"
	6)read the values of p ,n and r using scanf.
	7)devide n by 12.0 using / symbol and store the result in m, to convert time duration 		from months to years.
		Hint : m = n / 12.0;
	8)calculate simple interest using the below formula and store in si variable.
		si = p * m * r / 100;
	9) print si value to the user using printf.

4) calculate average of 4 integer numbers and print the output.

5) calculate and print area and perimeter of a rectangle

6) calculate and print area and perimeter of a square

7) calculate and print area and perimeter of a circle.

8) if sale price and profit of n items is given as inputs,  find the cost price of 1 item.
   eg., number of items : 15
        sale price of 15 items : 500
        profit : 50
        cost price of each item: 30
