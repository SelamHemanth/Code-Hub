1) Write a program that reads an integer and displays the right-most digit of the number.
(Eg: User enters, 456, the output should be 6).

2) read a 4 digit number and print it in the following different outputs using arithmetic operators

eg., 4532
OP1:
2
3
5
4

OP2:
4
5
3
2


OP3:

4
4 5
4 5 3
4 5 3 2


OP4:
4 5 3 2
4 5 3
4 5
4

OP5:

2 3 5 4  


OP6:

          2
       3
     5
  4


3) Swap the values of two integer variables 
eg., a = 4 , b = 5
write program to swap a and b values such that a value becomes 5 and b value becomes 4.

4) Read 3 numerical characters ( using %c read any one of the 0 to 9 digits) into 3 different variables. Combine the given numeric characters into a single integer by giving proper place values.

eg., input : 4    6    7    (stored in c1, c2, c3 usng %c)

combine c1, c2 and c3, and store it as a single number in d.

output: 467 ( print d value using %d)


5) Read a date in d-m-y format, and print it back in d\m\y format. 
eg., input : 3-4-2000

output: 3/4/2000

6) Take three input integers x,y and z. Write a program to rotate their values such that, x has the value of y, y has the value of z and z has the value of x.

Assignments using conditional statements (use only what was taught in class. Do not use && , || operators)

1) Write a program to find the biggest of two numbers using.
input: enter 2 numbers : 17  18
output: 18 is biggest 

2) Write a program to find the biggest of three numbers.
input: enter 3 numbers: 17 18 15
output: 18 is biggest

3) Write a program that determines whether a given integer is odd or even and displays the appropriate message.
input: enter a number : 15
15 is odd
input: enter a number: 24
24 is even

4) For one type of mobile service, if cost is 250/- upto 100 calls and 1.25/- for each call made over and above 100 calls. Write a program to read number of calls made and compute and print the bill.

input: enter number of calls: 102
output: bill : 252.50/-

input : enter number of calls: 90
output: bill: 250/-

5) read a character and print if the character is an alphabet or not. (Use nested if else statements) 

input: enter a character: t
output: t is an alphabet

input: enter a character : +
output: + is not an alphabet

input: enter a character 3
output: 3 is not an alphabet


6) Take an integer as input and print its magnitude (remove sign).

input: enter a number: -15
output: 15

input: enter a number: 15
output: 15

7) check if an year is leap year or not. number divisible with 100 but not divisible with 400 is not a leap year. number not divisible with 100 but divisible with 4 is a leap year.
Divisibility is determined using % operator, by checking the remainder for 0.

input:  1900      
1900 is not a leap year
input: 2004
2004 is a leap year
input: 2002
2002 is not a leap year
