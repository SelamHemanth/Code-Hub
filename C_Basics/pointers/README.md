1 Write a program to print the address of a variable , its value ,its size, try different executions and note the address printed. Assign the address of the variable to a pointer variable.Print the size of pointer and its indirected value (apply * operator).

2 Write a program to add two variables using thier pointers.

3 Write a program to take input for two character variables using pointers and find out which character has higher ascii value.

4 Declare 3 integer variables. Declare an integer pointer. Assign the address of each variable to the pointer in succession and print the value of the variable using indirection operator on the pointer.

5 Declare 3 pointer variables of integer type, and an integer variable. Assign the address of integer variable to the 3 pointers. Print the variable value using indirection on each pointer variable. Change the variable value directly and check the values of each of the pointers using indirection. Change the variable value , using each pointer and print the variable value and indirected values of all pointers every time you change.

6 declare different pointers with different data types. Print the sizes of the pointer variables using sizeof operator. Why do u think all of them are giving same size irrespective of the data type ?

7 Write a program to find the biggest of three numbers using pointers that point to those numbers.

8 Take three input integers x,y and z. Write a program to rotate their values such that, x has the value of y, y has the value of z and z has the value of x. Do this using pointers that point to x,y and z.

9 Declare an integer array of size 10 and initialize it to some values. Print the addresses of each element of the array using a pointer. using indirection operator , print the value stored in each element of the array.
