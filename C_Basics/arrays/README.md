1 Write the following program :
Declare an integer array of size 100.
Assign numbers 1-100 to each element of the array.
Print all the numbers.
Print all even elements.
Print all odd elements.
Add 5 to each element and print 6 – 105 numbers.

2 Write the following program :
Declare a character array without size.
Initialize the array with characters of your name.
Print your name using for loop.

3 Declare an array of size 10. Enter 10 elements and save them in the array. Print the array . Find out the biggest and smallest numbers and their indexes and print.
 
4 Try experimenting with the below array syntaxes and see the results,check their sizes, try to also read values for elements and print them:</br>
int arr[5] = {};
int arr[10] = {2.4,5.6,7.3};
int arr[3] = {1,2,3,4,5};
int arr[0] = {};
int arr[0] = {1,2,3,4,5};
int arr[] = {};
int arr[‘a’];

5 Write the following program.
Declare an integer variable ‘size’.
Take the value of ‘size’ from user using scanf.
Declare an array of any datatype, and give the integer variable ‘size’, in place of size of the array  and initialize it to some values.(syntax: float array[size] = {1.0,2.5};)
Using for loop, try to take user input using scanf. Loop should execute ‘size’ number of times.
Using for loop, print the elements of the array.

6 Write a function to search for a specific element given by the user, in an array and display its index.  Function takes array and element to search as inputs, and returns the index as output. If element not found, return -1.

7 Write a program to print an array in reverse order.

8 Write a program to reverse an array and print it (Reverse the array by swapping both edges of the array and move inside and repeat till middle of the array):  
Input : array1 ={1,2,3,4,5};
Output : array1 = {5,4,3,2,1};

9 Write a program to print an integer in binary format using arrays.

10 Write a program to swap two arrays in reverse order.
eg.,
input : array1 = {1,2,3,4,5};
array2 = {6,7,8,9,10};


output:

array1 : {10,9,8,7,6}
array2: { 5,4,3,2,1}

11 Write a function to return the average of marks of all students in a class.

12 Write a function to modify the array such that all negative numbers are converted to positive.

13) write a function to take 2 arrays as input and return 1 if they are equal and 0 if they are not equal ( sizes to be sent as seperate arguments)

14) write a function to take an array as input, and count how many times the biggest number is repeated in that array, and return the count.
eg., array : {10, 14,16,10, 10 , 16, 14, 14, 16, 16};

output : biggest number is repeated 4 times
