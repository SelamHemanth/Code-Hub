1)  In a bank application, read the amount to be deposited as positive number, and amount to withdraw as a negative number and print the total deposited amount  and total withdrawn amount separately at the end of the loop. When amount is entered as 0, the loop must stop.

2)  In above program, count the number of deposits and number of withdrawals and print separately. 

3) Read the 6 subject marks of n students and calculate percentage of each student, and count how many of them got distinction ( >75% and passed in all subjects) , 1st class( >60% and passed in all subjects) , 2nd class( >50% and passed in all subjects) and how many of them failed (< 35% in any one subject ).

4) read an integer and print the number of digits in it. 

eg., 
input1: 456
output : 3

input2: 0
output: 1

5) read an integer and print the sum of its digits.

6) read two integers and find the quotient and remainder of the numbers after division, without using / or % operators.

input : 14 4
output: quotient :  3
remainder: 2

7) read a number and print if it is prime number or not ( A prime number has only 2 factors, one and itself)

8) print how many numbers are divisible with 10 between two given numbers. print all the numbers.

eg., input: 18  37
output: 
the following numbers are divisible with 10:  20 30
Total number of 10 divisible numbers : 2

9) write calculator program to repeat as long as user is giving options between '+','-','*', '/' and '%'. If user enters any other character, then the loop should stop.

10) Modify the calculator program to perform the operations continuously until the user chooses not to continue further. Every time after the option, ask "Do you want to continue? press any key to continue, n to stop.". If user presses n, then stop the loop.
