##What is the difference between fork, vfork and exec system call?

1.fork():-
----------
	The fork() system call creates a new process that is a copy of the calling process. The new process has its own memory space, but it initially shares the same code and data segments as the calling process. The new process also has its own execution context, including its own program counter and stack pointer.

2.vfork():-
----------
	The vfork() system call is a variant of the fork() system call that is designed to be more efficient for certain types of applications. The vfork() system call creates a new process that shares the same memory space as the calling process. This means that the new process does not have to copy the memory pages of the calling process, which can save a lot of time. However, the vfork() system call also means that the calling process cannot be suspended after the vfork() system call returns. This is because the calling process is still sharing its memory space with the new process, and if the calling process were to be suspended, the new process would be able to modify the memory of the calling process.

3.exec():-
----------
	The exec() system call is used to replace the current process image with a new process image. This means that the current process will be replaced with a new process that is loaded from an executable file. The exec() system call can be used to start a new program or to run an existing program.
