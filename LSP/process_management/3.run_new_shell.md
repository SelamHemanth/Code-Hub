# How to start a new process in a shell? Explain with an example how the ls command works?

##How to start a new process in a shell:
	Normally, Using the ampersand (&) symbol: 
			This method appends the ampersand (&) symbol to the end of a command, indicating that the command should be executed in the background. The shell creates a new process for the command and returns immediately, allowing you to continue using the shell while the command runs in the background.

##How ls command works in shell:

km@KernelMasters:~$ ls -l &
[1] 11408
km@KernelMasters:~$ total 24
-rw-rw-r-- 1 km km 1281 Nov 15 22:29 1.Zombie_and_orphan_process.c
-rw-rw-r-- 1 km km 1455 Nov 15 22:38 2.Diff_between_fork_vfork_exec.md
-rwxrwxr-x 1 km km 8592 Nov 15 22:27 a.out
drwxrwxr-x 2 km km 4096 Nov 15 22:31 mini_project

The curser is keep on waiting for another command.when we enter any command and  press ENTER key the command will be executed and background process is ended.The it displays like below,

[1]+  Done                    ls --color=auto -l


By using ,below command we can find its process information.

km@KernelMasters:~$ ps -eaf | grep 11408
km       11411 11177  0 22:48 pts/0    00:00:00 grep --color=auto 11408
