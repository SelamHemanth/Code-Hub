1) create an integer dynamically ,read and print its value.

2) create a string dynamically, read and print its value.

3) create a string dynamically, copy a string constant to it ( "Kernel"). Create another string dynamically. Copy the first string to second string.

4) Create a dynamic array of integers. Take input from user , sort the array and display the output.

5) Implement itoa function and return the string from the function. Print the result in main. itoa function takes an integer as input, and stores the integer in a string.

6) Write a function, that takes two strings as input and concatenates only the first n characters from first string and first m characters from second string and makes a new string.
eg., input str1 = "kernel masters", str2 = "raayan systems", n = 3, m = 5
output : kerraaya

7)Write a function that takes a main string and two sub strings (need not be same length), and replace every occurrence of first substring with the second substring in main string and return a new string as output.

eg., input : kernel  e   xxx

output: kxxxrnxxxl

8)  Write a function that takes two sorted integer arrays as input, and returns an array of integers from both arrays in sorted order, excluding duplicate numbers. 
Assume that the input arrays are sorted.
eg., array1 : 10,12,13,14,15,16
array2 : 9,12,15,19,20
output array3 : 9,10,12,13,14,15,16,19,20
