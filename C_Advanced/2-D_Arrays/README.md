1	Declare a two-dimensional array of elements for sales details of a store, for each item, for each sales man. Take the sales values as input and print the array in matrix form.
Find out and print the following :
1 ) Total sales by each sales man
2 ) Total sales for a item
3 ) Total sales
2	Write the following program :
Declare a two dimensional array of elements and find and print its transpose.
eg., if the matrix is :       1 3
                                          4 5
                                          7 8

its transpose should be :     1 4 7
                                                3 5 8
3	Write a program  for matrix addition and subtraction.
4	Write a program  for matrix multiplication.
5	Search for an element in a two dimentional array, and print its position - as row and column numbers. write a search function that will receive the array and return row and column indexes as output.
